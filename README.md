## Manifest V3 Migration

This extension has been updated to use **Manifest V3** for compatibility with modern Chrome browsers.

### Key Changes Made:

- Updated `manifest_version` from 2 to 3
- Replaced `background.scripts` with `background.service_worker`
- Changed `browser_action` to `action`
- Combined background scripts (`event.js` and `install.js`) into a single `background.js` service worker
- Updated deprecated API calls (e.g., `chrome.tabs.getSelected` â†’ `chrome.tabs.query`)

### Features:

- **Context Menu Download**: Right-click on images to download them directly
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl+Shift+E` (or `Cmd+Shift+E` on Mac) to save the current image and close the tab
- **Twitter Image Enhancement**: Automatically downloads high-resolution versions of Twitter images
- **Download Shelf Management**: Automatically disables the Chrome download shelf
- **Options UI**: A dark-themed options page to toggle behaviors and set filename templates (`options.html`)
- **Filename Templating**: Use templates like `{domain}/{basename}` to organize downloads into folders and name files automatically
- **Download Notifications**: Desktop notifications on download complete or interrupted
- **Code Cleanup**: Consolidated background logic and removed legacy duplicated files for maintainability

## Documentation & Agent Policy (MANDATORY)

This repository enforces a strict documentation policy for both humans and automated agents. Follow these rules without exception:

- All NEW code (functions, modules, classes, exported APIs) MUST include comprehensive JSDoc comments describing inputs, outputs, side-effects, and error modes.
- Existing documentation (README.md, AGENTS.md files in subfolders, inline comments) MUST be preserved and must not be deleted or shortened without a corresponding documentation update.
- Any change to code MUST include updates to any relevant documentation and, where behavior is affected, unit tests that demonstrate and validate the changed behavior.
- Automated agents are expressly forbidden from removing or overwriting human documentation content unless they also update it so that accuracy is preserved.

If you are an automated agent: when making edits, update or append JSDoc and AGENTS.md entries. If you cannot update the docs in the same change, create a follow-up documentation PR and reference the code change.
